# Javascript Project Proposal: Array Match #

## Background: ##

**Array-Match** is an educational puzzle game utilizing arrays and Javascript 
array methods. Players will manipulate a given board (2D Array) in order to 
solve puzzles by combining cards that include numbers and array methods. There 
are two types of cards which a player may use:

1) Method Cards (ie. slice, push, unshift, etc.)
2) Argument Cards (ie. 1, 2, 3, etc.)

By combining method and argument cards, a player will be able to manipulate the 
board and their hand. Combining a method and argument card will cause the method
to execute with the argument card passed in. Cards like pop and shift will allow
players to keep the card that was removed from the board, creating a more unique
and complicated layer to later levels.
